== Outcome

=== Take-Away Notes
* With ArchUnit ...
** ... you cannot prevent that constants referring to Java-primitives or Strings from forbidden packages or layers are used, as ArchUnit currently executes its tests against the bytecode (see Annotated Example below)
** ... you cannot totally prevent a forbidden import instruction to appear in your Java class. Anyhow: Coding against forbidden classes is nearly impossible (see Annotated Example below).
